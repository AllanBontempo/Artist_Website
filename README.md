I made this web site for the artist Thiago de Paula to publish his projects and sell his products.


It's my first project as a developer. I really enjoyed doing it! 

I know there may be some imperfections such as semantics, unnecessary classes, but this whole project made me see what work is like in practice and I am very happy to have achieved this result in the first project.
