I made this web site for the artist Thiago de Paula to publish his projects and sell his products.

The main objective of the site is to show the artist's projects, to be his portfolio.<br>
Your books and comics will be read as a virtual book, without the need for downloads, leaving the reader with a comfortable reading experience.




It's my first project as a developer. I really enjoyed doing it!
